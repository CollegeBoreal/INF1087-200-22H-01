### Why choosing Wordpress on Docker-compose?

WordPress is one of the most popular content management software (CMS) because of its multitude of features and ease of use. 
Setting up a new web host environment can be time-consuming especially if you need to do it often. Docker Compose manages to simplify the installation process to a single deployment command. It will reduce the time and effort required.
Deploying WordPress with Docker Compose is fast and easy after the first time setup.
